iTunes Connect AutoIngest
===========

This is a python script that wraps the itunes autoingest function to download daily sales reports int a MySQL database.
In addition to this file, the config file and properties file, you will need to download and drop this file from apple into the folder
in which you would like to store the reports.

You will need to create a mysql instance similar to what is detailed below or feel free to change the query strings as necessary (this was built to conform to my system).
